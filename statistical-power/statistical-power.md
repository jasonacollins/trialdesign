# Statistical power, error control, and effect sizes

In this topic's content, we will explore some elements related to statistical power. The concept of the statistical power of a trial refers to the **probability of detecting a difference between study groups when such a difference exists**. The power is determined by several factors, including the magnitude of the effect, the study design, and the sample size.

In the next few pages we will discuss:

- Type I and Type II errors
- Statistical power
- Power analysis
- Effect sizes
