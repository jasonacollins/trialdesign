<p>It may be useful in your journey of running a trial to conduct a literature review of existing articles. <span><em>Literature </em>refers here to a collection of published materials on a particular area of research or topic, such as books and journal articles.</span> A literature review seeks to summarize the information that existing studies have gathered on these issues. It will help you answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What studies have already been done in this area?</li>
<li>Are there gaps in the evidence?</li>
<li>What are some of the general lessons that emerge from the many different studies?</li>
</ul>
<p>You can search for articles using existing databases in our <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.lib.uts.edu.au/" target="_blank">UTS library</a> or with sources such as <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://scholar.google.com/" target="_blank">Google scholar.</a></p>
<p>Once you have selected the studies, it is important to be able to read or skim-read them in an educated way.&nbsp;Over the following pages, we will discuss this more in-depth and provide you with examples.&nbsp;</p>
