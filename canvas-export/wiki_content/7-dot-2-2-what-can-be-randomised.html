<p><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">There are three basic ways in which a program can be randomised.</span></p>
<div class="enhanceable_content tabs">
<ul>
<li style="border: solid 1px #C7CDD1;">
<h2><a style="font-size: 14pt; text-decoration: none;" href="#tab-1"><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Access</span></strong></a></h2>
</li>
<li style="border: solid 1px #C7CDD1;">
<h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="#tab-2"><strong>Timing</strong></a></span></h2>
</li>
<li style="border: solid 1px #C7CDD1;">
<h2><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><a style="text-decoration: none;" href="#tab-3"><strong>Encouragement</strong></a></span></h2>
</li>
</ul>
<div id="tab-1" style="font-size: 1rem; border: solid 1px #C7CDD1; border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;">
<div class="content-box">
<div class="grid-row">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-5">
<div class="styleguide-section__grid-demo-element">
<p>We can choose which people are offered <strong>access</strong> to a program.</p>
<p>This is the most common way to randomise.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-7">
<div class="styleguide-section__grid-demo-element">
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini" style="background-color: #f3e8ff; padding: 20px;">
<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Draw a list of 200 eligible branches and then randomly select 100 to receive the new product."</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

</div>
<div id="tab-2" style="font-size: 1rem; border: solid 1px #C7CDD1; border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;">
<p>We can choose <strong>when</strong> people are offered access.</p>
<p>Sometimes, everyone needs access to the program (e.g. by law, fairness). We can randomly assign the time when people get access to the program.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a new medical treatment is proposed. Group A could get the treatment in Year 1, Group B in Year 2 and Group C in Year 3. Groups B and C are control groups in Year 1. Group C is a control group in Year 2.</p>
<p><strong>Phase-in designs</strong> may result in "anticipatory effects". The anticipation of treatment may affect the behaviour of the control group, leading to an overestimate or underestimate of the impact.</p>
<p>For example, consider a program that provides a laptop to each student at schools.&nbsp;Suppose some parents of children in the control group that planned to purchase a home computer before the evaluation decided not to purchase it and wait for their child to receive a laptop. This behavioural change is important: some parents in control group behaved differently than they would have if the program did not exist. They are no longer the best representation of the counterfactual.</p>
<p>Another implication of phase-in designs is that, since the control group receives treatment after a fixed time frame, there is a limited time over&nbsp;which impact can be measured. The evaluation of the program’s impact will be of short-term outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div id="tab-3" style="font-size: 1rem; border: solid 1px #C7CDD1; border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;">
<p>We can choose which people are <strong>encouraged</strong> to participate</p>
<div class="content-box">
<div class="grid-row">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-5">
<div class="styleguide-section__grid-demo-element">
<p>Encouragement might be a small incentive, a letter, or a phone call that reminds people of their eligibility and details the steps to enrol in the program. Messaging is a form of encouragement design.</p>
<p>Encouragement is useful to evaluate a program already open to all eligible recipients, but only some are currently using it.&nbsp;Effective encouragement leads to higher take-up of the program in the treatment group than in the control group.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the impact of receiving encouragement to take up the program is evaluated (and its indirect effect on program take-up), rather than the direct impact of the program itself.</p>

<p>When studying the program's impact, comparing the entire treatment group to the entire control group is important.&nbsp;When analysing the results, individuals in the treatment group who receive encouragement but do not apply for the program must still be considered a part of the treatment group.&nbsp;Similarly, individuals in the control group who apply for the program without special encouragement must remain in the control group for analysis.</p>
<p>Encouragement designs attract the following considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The program to be evaluated must be undersubscribed.</li>
<li>To generate impact estimates, the encouragement must induce significantly higher&nbsp;take-up rates in the treatment group compared to the control group.</li>
<li>The encouragement should not have a direct effect on the outcome.</li>
<li>Everyone must be affected by the encouragement incentive in the same direction.&nbsp;If the encouragement itself increases the take-up of some groups and reduces the take-up of others, impact estimates will likely be biased.</li>
