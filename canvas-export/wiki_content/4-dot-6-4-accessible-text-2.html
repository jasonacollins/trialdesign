<li>Unit of measurement: What is the unit at which your outcomes will be measured? Randomisation cannot occur at a lower level than our measured outcome. For example, we need to randomise at the firm (not the worker) level to study the effect of worker training on firm profits.</li>
<li>Spillovers: Are there spillovers in that the intervention changes outcomes for those not directly participating? Do we want the impact estimate to capture them? Do we want to measure them? Cluster randomisation is used to control for contamination across individuals, as a change in behaviour in one might change the behaviour of others. For example, suppose you are implementing a trial to improve on-time tax return submissions by phoning taxpayers. You want to test what scripts and tools for call centre staff most effectively increase on-time submission. If you randomise at the staff--member level, staff in the control group may become aware of other approaches in their centre and change their behaviour.</li>
<li>Attrition: Attrition is when we cannot collect data on all our sample. Which level is best to keep participants from dropping out of the sample? For example, sometimes providing benefits to a person but not their neighbour is considered unfair. If people feel a study is unfair, they can refuse to cooperate, leading to attrition. Randomising at a higher level can help.</li>
<li>Compliance: compliance is when all those in the treatment group get the program and all those in the comparison donâ€™t. Which level is best to limit departures from the study protocol? For example, if iron supplements are provided to one family member, what if they share with others? They would receive less than intended and the other family member more.</li>
<li>Statistical power: Statistical power is the ability to detect an effect of a given size. Which level gives us the greatest probability of detecting a treatment? Cluster randomisation reduces power by effectively reducing the sample size.</li>
<li>Feasibility: Which level is ethically, financially, politically and logistically feasible?</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Ethics: Randomising at an individual level may create tensions that lead to harm if some are seen as unfairly chosen. Randomising at the group level raises issues about seeking informed consent.</li>
<li>Politics: Allocation may seem arbitrary when people with equal needs interacting regularly are assigned to different groups.</li>
<li>Logistics:&nbsp;Sometimes, it is not practicable to randomise experimental subjects individually.&nbsp;In the staff training example above, training in the tools is provided at staff briefings at the beginning of each shift, making it impracticable to randomise across call centre staff within the centre.</li>
<li>Cost: If you randomise at the suburb level, we usually have to treat everyone in the suburb.</li>
