<p>Large Language Models (LLM) can support you in code development.</p>
</div>
<h2>Large Language Models</h2>
<p>The quickest way to incorporate a large language model into your code development is to ask a tool such as ChatGPT to produce code.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Please give me R code to determine the required sample size for a test of proportions with 80% power. Assume p1=0.5 and p2=0.6.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The code produced will often have errors or not perform as expected, but it will give you a place to start. If you receive an error or a result that does not make sense, you can ask ChatGPT follow-up questions about the error and how to fix it.</p>
<p>You can also turn to ChatGPT to solve errors in your code. If you cannot determine what is wrong, paste the code into ChatGPT and ask what is wrong with the code.</p>
<h2>GitHub CoPilot</h2>
<p><span><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://github.com/features/copilot" target="_blank">GitHub CoPilot</a> is badged as “your coding companion”, providing code suggestions in coding environments.</span></p>
<p><span>To access CoPilot, you need to use an IDE such as Visual Studio Code. CoPilot is not available in RStudio.</span></p>
<p>If you are a student, you can sign up for (free) academic access to CoPilot at <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application" target="_blank">this link</a>. You will need a GitHub account to do this.</p>
<p>Visual Studio Code is available <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">here</a>. Download and install.</p>
<p>Install the GitHub CoPilot extension into Visual Studio Code. Instructions on installing the extension are <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/quickstart#installing-the-github-copilot-extension-for-visual-studio-code" target="_blank">here</a>. On installation, you’ll be prompted to log in to GitHub to gain access to authorise CoPilot.</p>
<p>Once you have done that, you will be given suggestions as you type. If you are typing in an R script, you can type comments (text preceded by #), which are effectively instructions from which CoPilot will produce code.</p>
