<p>Although we want to determine a "truth" about the interventions we have developed and which of our hypotheses hold, there are different ways in statistics to reach this truth. We can use different tools to design our experiment and analyse our experimental data.</p>
<p>We are not going to examine all of these alternatives in depth, but here are three major approaches:</p>

<div class="grid-row">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-md-4">

<div style="background-color: #efe5f9; padding: 15px 30px; min-height: 220px;">
<p><strong>Frequentist statistics</strong> provides a set of rules for when we should reject a null hypothesis. This approach won't give you the right answer for every single test, but in the long-run you will be correct a certain percentage of the time (and you get to set that percentage).</p>

<div class="styleguide-section__grid-demo-element">
<div style="background-color: #f2e5f9; padding: 15px 30px; min-height: 220px;">
<p><strong>Likelihoods</strong> tell you the likelihood of different hypotheses given the data that you have collected.</p>

<div style="background-color: #f5e5f9; padding: 15px 30px; min-height: 220px;">
<p><strong>Bayesian statistics</strong> is built on the idea of prior beliefs. You won't just look at the data you have collected. You will also consider your prior beliefs and consider how much you should update your beliefs given the data. This then gives you a "posterior belief" as to the probability that the hypothesis is true.</p>

<p>There is a large scientific debate between the adherents of these different approaches. However, we will focus on the frequentist approach in this subject. It is the most common approach in academic and applied behavioural science, and understanding this paradigm will enable you to engage with most of the academic literature.</p>
