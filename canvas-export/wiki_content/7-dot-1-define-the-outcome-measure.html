<h2>Observable signals of changes</h2>
<p>An important part of the trial design is to define observable signals of changes.</p>
<p><em>Impact </em>is the changes our program aims to achieve. Often these changes are conceptual, such as “financial wellbeing.”</p>
<p><em>Outcomes </em>are observable signals of these changes, such as “credit card balance” or “ability to read a simple paragraph.” Indicators measure whether the impact is in fact happening. If an evaluation is to be influential in broader policy debates, it is useful to include outcome measures and indicators that are commonly used in the literature for assessing programs with similar objectives.</p>

<p>An outcome measure must be:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Observable</strong>: it must be a behavior or state that can be observed in the real world. Happiness is not an observable indicator, but self-reported happiness is.</li>
<li><strong>Feasible</strong>: it must be feasible to measure politically, ethically and financially.</li>
<li><strong>Detectable</strong>: it must be detectable with your instruments and statistical power (to which we will come back in Module 3) of your experiments.&nbsp;</li>

<h3>When designing instruments don't forget social-desirability bias <span>&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>When designing your instrument, you need to think about the possibility of <strong>social-desirability bias.</strong> It is a form of response bias in which participants&nbsp;prefer to answer questions<strong> </strong>in a way that will be viewed favourably by others instead of reporting the truth.<sup id="cite_ref-Krumpal2013_1-0" class="reference"></sup> It can take the form of over-reporting "good behaviour" or under-reporting "bad", or undesirable behaviour. Social-desirability bias is more likely to occur when the topic of the question is a sensitive one. Potential ways to reduce social-desirability bias includes (i) using computer-assisted interviews instead of face-to-face or phone interviews, (ii) providing financial incentives for reporting the truth, (iii) using proxy indicators (e.g. childbearing instead of unprotected sex) or (iv) conducting a list experiment.</p>
<p><span>Voting is typically a sensitive topic. During the U.S. 2016 presidential campaign featuring Hillary Clinton (Democratic candidate) against Donald J. Trump (Republican candidate), pre-election polls showed Clinton leading Trump in the battleground states that decided the presidency. There are several reasons that may explain why they got it wrong. One of them may be social-desirability bias. Brownback and Novotny (2018) conducted three list experiments to test this and found evidence that explicit polling overstates agreement with Clinton relative to Trump.</span></p>

<h3>What is a list experiment?</h3>
<p><span>Suppose you are trying to gauge support for a political position, but responses are clouded by social desirability bias.</span></p>
<p><span>One approach to overcoming social desirability bias is to use a list experiment. </span><span>In a list experiment, the sample is randomly divided into two groups. The first group is presented with a list of neutral and non-sensitive items (length=N). The second group is presented with an identical list plus the sensitive item (length=N+1). They are then asked how many of the items they agree with.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, the first group might be asked: How many of the following statements do you agree with?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Ice cream is better than bacon.</span></li>
<li><span>Summer is the best season.</span></li>
<li><span>Bicycle riders should not have to wear helmets</span><span>.</span></li>
<li><span>AFL is the most Australian sport.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The second group would be shown the same list, plus an additional item, such as:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>I will vote for Donald Trump in the next Presidential election.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Note that the group members are not asked which items they agree with. They are only asked <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how many</span>. This gives the respondent a degree of privacy. A researcher could not conclusively determine whether a person would vote for Donald Trump unless the person answered 0 or N+1.</span></p>
<p><span>With a large enough sample, researchers can estimate the proportion of people to whom the sensitive item pertains, in this case, voting for Trump, by subtracting the average number of agreements of the first group from the average number of agreements of the second group. For example, if the average number of agreements is 2.6 in the first and 3.2 in the second, the average number of agreements with the Trump statement is 0.6. This can be done as the responses to the non-sensitive questions across the two groups should, with large enough sample, be equal.</span></p>
<h3>Case study</h3>
<div class="styleguide-section__grid-demo-element">
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini border border-trbl" style="border: thin solid#000000; padding: 15px 30px;">
<h4><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">An HIV education program in Kenya</span></h4>
This case study taken from Glennerster and Takavarasha (2013) illustrate a two-step process for selecting outcomes and instruments during program evaluation: (1) mapping the theory of change and (2) determining indicators that are the logical consequences of each step in the theory of change.
<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9; margin: 25px 0px; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; border-left: 6px solid #a257ff;">
<p>A program in Kenya provided in-service training for teachers to improve their delivery of HIV prevention education in primary schools.</p>
<p>The training focused on how to teach HIV/AIDS prevention best practices while teaching other subjects and how to start and run after&nbsp; school student health clubs devoted to HIV/AIDS education.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A simple theory of change for the program says that teacher training (1) increased HIV education, which (2) increased knowledge of prevention best practices, which (3) reduced unsafe sexual behavior, which (4) led to reduced HIV infection rates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HIV status is the ultimate outcome of interest. If we can measure HIV status in both our treatment and our comparison groups, we can know whether our program changed HIV infection rates. Although testing HIV status is common in the literature, it may be too expensive as well as ethically, politically, or logistically infeasible in our context. If this is the case, we can use other indicators as proxies for HIV rates, such as self-reported sexual behavior or childbearing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We may also be interested in more proximate outcomes, such as changes in knowledge, that are not captured by HIV status. Indeed, HIV status is not a valid measure of knowledge of best practices, because someone may know the best prevention methods but choose to not practice them. Measuring these intermediate outputs and outcomes would allow us to learn about the underlying mechanisms that can translate program inputs into impacts. For example, if the program failed to achieve the desired impact, did it fail because it did not change knowledge or because changing knowledge did not change behaviour?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"> <span>The following table shows the program theory. For each of the concepts in the causal chain, it also suggests potential indicator in the real world that we can observe and measure.&nbsp;</span> </span></p>
