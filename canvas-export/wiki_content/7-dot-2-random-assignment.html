<p style="margin: 12px 0px; color: #252b2b; font-family: 'Lato Extended', Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;">In its simplest form, randomised trials work by splitting trial participants into two or more groups by random lot. Each group is then given a different intervention, with one of those groups typically a "control group" (or "test group" or "comparison group") that receives no intervention or the status quo.</p>
<p style="margin: 12px 0px; color: #252b2b; font-family: 'Lato Extended', Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;">Randomisation works as a control technique because it enables experimenters to hold approximately equal the sources of experimental bias, such as uncontrolled variables, between the control and treatment groups. These might even be variables of which we are ignorant.</p>

<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9; margin: 25px 0px; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; border-left: 6px solid #6926ab;">
<p>Suppose researchers in 1950 wanted to test the efficacy of a pill designed to reduce blood pressure but did not know that about 10 percent of the human species has a specific gene variant that predisposes them to adult-onset hypertension. If the researchers selected 3,000 people, and randomly assigned 1,500 to a test group who are given the pill and 1,500 to a control group who received a placebo, then about 150 patients in each group should have the gene variant of interest (though the researchers would have no explicit information about this and wouldn’t even have thought to investigate it). Therefore, when these researchers compared the change in blood pressure before and after taking the pill for the test group versus the control group, their estimate would not be biased by a much higher proportion of patients with the gene variant of interest in one group or the other.</p>

<p>Randomisation relies on the law of large numbers, the idea that as sample size increases the sample average converges to the expected value. In the case of the experiment to reduce blood pressure, as the size of the groups increased, we would expect the proportion of people with the hypertension genetic variant to converge to around 10% in each group.</p>
<p>To think of what that means intuitively, if you had only ten in each group, there is a material chance the groups could have zero, one, or more people with the hypertension variant, although it would rarely be three or more. Therefore, with a small sample, the relative proportions of the variant could vary markedly between groups. It is only by collecting large samples that we can expect the groups to approximately equal proportions.</p>

<p>After randomisation and application of the treatment, outcomes are then measured for each group. Within certain statistical parameters (also to be covered later in this unit), we can then take the differences between the two groups to be as a result of the different interventions we received. The treatment "caused" the differences, although as noted above, we may not understand the mechanism.</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;">What is involved in practice?</span></h2>
<p>In practice, random assignment includes the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Define those eligible for a program.</li>
<li>Decide the level of randomisation (such as individuals, communities, schools, call centres, bank branches). When you design a randomized evaluation, you need to decide whether to randomise individuals in and out of the program or to randomise the whole group in and out of the program.</li>
<li>Power Analysis: Decide the sample size.</li>
<li>Randomly assign which units (individuals or groups) are in the treatment, and the control group. Groups might be allocated randomly by drawing numbers out of a hat, flipping a coin or, more commonly in experimental work, using a pseudo-random number generator. It is not the experimenter that decides who gets an intervention or not, but rather chance.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will cover some of these steps, such as power analysis, in more detail later in the subject.</p>
