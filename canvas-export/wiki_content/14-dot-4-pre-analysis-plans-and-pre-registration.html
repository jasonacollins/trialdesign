<div class="ic-flash-info" style="border-color: #7519d1; max-width: 70%; text-align: center;">A pre-analysis plan is a step-by-step plan setting out how you will analyse the data from your experiment. It is written before data collection, or at least before seeing the data.</div>

<p style="margin: 12px 0px; color: #252b2b; font-family: 'Lato Extended', Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;">Components of a pre-analysis plan typically include:</p>
<ul style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px 0px 6px 25px; color: #252b2b; font-family: 'Lato Extended', Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;">
<li>A description of the sample that will be used, including proposed sample size and randomisation techniques</li>
<li>The hypotheses to be tested</li>
<li>How any variables will be constructed (i.e. you may be planning to manipulate data in the analysis, such as by excluding outlier values or transforming it to log levels)</li>
<li>What statistical tests will be used</li>
<li>How you will deal with multiple outcomes</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="color: #252b2b; font-family: 'Lato Extended', Lato, 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;">Commitment to a pre-analysis plan is required to be able to take p-values at their face value. Why? A p-value is the probability of the data on the assumption that the null hypotheses is true. As we noted before, our measurement of the data is a test statistic such as a z-score. But your measurement of the data relies on the analysis you choose. If you change that analysis based on the data you see (e.g. by excluding outliers or measuring at a different point in time or using a different outcome measure) your p-value is no longer the probability of the data given the null hypothesis is true. The p-value is now the probability of the data given the null hypothesis is true and given you made a series of choices.</span></p>

<p>To put this into more practical terms, all of the choices that are specified in a pre-analysis plan affect the chance of "success" of a trial. The more degrees of freedom you allow yourself in your analysis, the more likely you are to stumble upon a p-value lower than 0.05 by chance. Don't find anything at 6 months, try 12. Maybe exclude the outlier. And so on.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;">Pre-registration</span></h2>
<p>Pre-registration is the publication of the pre-analysis plan in a public archive. This acts as a form of commitment to the pre-analysis plan and enables others to verify that you have done the analysis as you stated.</p>
<p>As an example, BETA at PM&amp;C pre-registers many of its studies. You can see some of the pre-registered studies by clicking on the <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/search?search%5Binvestigator_name%5D=BETA+Team+Registration" target="_blank">following link</a>.</p>
