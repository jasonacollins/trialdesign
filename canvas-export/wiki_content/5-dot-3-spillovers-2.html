<p>Spillovers occur when the effect on those receiving treatment produces a secondary effect on those not treated.<br>If there are positive (negative) spillovers, the estimated impact will be an underestimate (overestimate).</p>
<div class="content-box pad-box-mini" style="background-color: #fbe9ff; padding: 20px;">
<p>Some types of spillovers include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Physical: For example, people immunised by a program reduce disease transmission in their community.</li>
    <li>Behavioural: For example, if some children go to school more, this may encourage others to go.</li>
    <li>Informational: For example, people learn about the usefulness of a new financial&nbsp;app from others who received this knowledge from the program.</li>
    <li>Marketwide: For example, older workers lose their jobs because firms receive financial incentives from the program to hire young workers.</li>
</ul></div>
<p>Spillovers reduce the quality of the counterfactual. The comparison group is no longer as good a counterfactual because their outcomes reflect indirect program effects, not the outcomes in the absence of the program.</p>
<p>Spillovers become a threat to the evaluation if we do not consider them in the design and/or analysis phase.<br>If the evaluation does not capture or account for positive spillovers from treatment to comparison, the impact of the program will be underestimated. If it does not capture or account for negative spillovers, the impact will be overestimated.</p><div class="content-box pad-box-mini" style="background-color: #f4c9fe; padding: 20px;">
<p>We can manage spillovers by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identifying potential spillovers. That means asking the following questions: What, who, how? We can use common sense, previous studies, existing theories, and logical frameworks to anticipate potential spillovers</li>
    <li>Reducing spillovers to the comparison group. For example, could we change the level of randomization?</li>
    <li>Estimating the spillover effects by measuring outcomes of the untreated in or near the treated units.&nbsp;We need to systematically collect data on outcomes for those not directly treated but whom we expect to be affected indirectly (e.g. neighbours of people in the treatment and control group).</li>
</ul></div>
