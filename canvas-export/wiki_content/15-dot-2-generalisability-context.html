<p>Recall the jam experiment that we discussed previously.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;">Jam experiment recap</span></h2>
<p>On two Saturdays in a California supermarket, Mark Lepper and Sheena Iyengar set up tasting displays of either six or 24 jars of jam. Consumers could taste as many jams as they wished, and if they approached the tasting table they received a $1 discount coupon to buy the jam.</p>
<p>For attracting initial interest, the large display of 24 jams did a better job, with 60 per cent of people who passed the display stopping. Forty per cent of people stopped at the six jam display. But only three per cent of those who stopped at the 24 jam display purchased any of the jam, compared with almost 30 per cent who stopped at the six jam display.</p>

<p>This experiment has gained famed as showing the paradox of choice. But how much weight should we place on this one experiment? In his book Uncontrolled, Jim Manzi tackles asks how much weight we should place on an experiment involving 35 jars of jam. Does it imply that stores should eliminate 75% of their products for a 900% increase in sales? He writes:</p>
<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9; margin: 25px 0px; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; border-left: 6px solid #6f26ab;">
<p>Measurement problems could easily arise because the experiment was done for a total of ten hours in only one store, and shoppers were grouped in hourly chunks. There could be all kinds of reasons that those people who happened to show up during the five hours of limited assortment could have systematically different propensity to respond to $ 1 off a specific line of jams than those who arrived in the other five-hour period: a soccer game finished at some specific time, and several of the parents who share similar propensities versus the average shopper came in nearly together; a bad traffic jam in one part of town with non-average propensity to respond to the coupon dissuaded several people from going to the store at one time versus another; etc. This is one reason retail experiments for such in-store promotional tactics are typically executed for twenty or thirty randomly assigned stores for a period of weeks.</p>

<p>Benjamin Scheibehenne and friends surveyed the broader literature on the choice overload hypothesis. In some cases, choice increased purchases. In others, it reduced them. Scheibehenne and friends determined that the mean effect size of changing the number of choices across the studies was effectively zero.</p>
<p>From this result, Manzi notes the need for experiments to capture the background variation present across many stores, schools, courts or whatever the domain of interest is. They need to run over a long enough period to capture changing conditions over time. He continues:</p>
<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9; margin: 25px 0px; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; border-left: 6px solid #6f26ab;">
<p>The ultimate test of the validity of causal conclusions derived from an experiment is the ability to predict the results of future tests. We need to build the kind of distribution of multiple experiments that were summarized for the impact of breadth of choice on sales and satisfaction in Scheibehenne’s meta-analysis. Such a distribution allows us to measure the scope (if any) of reliable prediction based on some sequence of experiments. In the case of the jam experiment, the researchers in the original experiment themselves were careful about their explicit claims of generalizability, and significant effort has been devoted to the exact question of finding conditions under which choice overload occurs consistently, but popularizers telescoped the conclusions derived from one coupon-plus-display promotion in one store on two Saturdays, up through assertions about the impact of product selection for jam for this store, to the impact of product selection for jam for all grocery stores in America, to claims about the impact of product selection for all retail products of any kind in every store, ultimately to fairly grandiose claims about the benefits of choice to society.</p>
