<p>To conclude this module, watch the video below about the RAND Health Insurance Experiment in the US. Between 1974 and 1981, the RAND experiment provided health insurance to nearly 6,000 individuals from about 2,000 households across the US. The experiment randomly assigned the families to health insurance plans with different levels of cost sharing, ranging from full coverage health insurance (“free care”) to plans that provided almost no coverage for the first approximately $4,000 (in 2011 dollars) that were incurred during the year.</p>
<p>It is the most important health insurance study ever conducted, addressing two key questions in health care financing: (1) <span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">How much more medical care will people use if it is provided free of charge? (2) </span> <span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">What are the consequences for their health? It was also instrumental to develop new measures of health status that are widely used today.</span></p>
