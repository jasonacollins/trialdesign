<p>Imagine conducting a randomised controlled trial to test an intervention designed to increase on-time submission of tax returns. You have a hypothesis that social norms can improve submission outcomes. You randomise citizens into two groups, one receiving a standardised reminder, the other a reminder with a social norm pointing out that 90% of other people in their suburb submit their return on time.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;76% of people in the control group submit their tax return on time, compared to 79% in the treatment group. There is a 3 per cent difference between the two groups.</span></p>
<p>Can we be reasonably confident that this difference of 3 per cent is due to the treatment of the groups, or could it be due to chance?</p>
<p>Suppose we then repeat the experiment on a new group of subjects. And then another.</p>
<p>Across each of our repeats of the experiment, the precise results will almost surely not be repeated. Each time there will be measurement variability, environmental variability, variation in the treatment application (e.g. did we have fewer correct email addresses), variation between the subjects in each experiment, and so on. The result is that the intervention will appear more effective in some experiments than others simply by chance.</p>
<div class="ic-flash-info" style="border-color: #7519d1; max-width: 80%; text-align: center;">
<p>Hypothesis testing provides a statistical method(s) to infer whether differences between interventions in an experiment are a chance event or the result of a substantive difference in the effectiveness of the interventions.</p>
</div>
<p>In this revision module, we will examine some of the approaches to hypothesis testing, the statistical concepts we will use, and how "statistical significance" can filter our hypotheses.</p>
