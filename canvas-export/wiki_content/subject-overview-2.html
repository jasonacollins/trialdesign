<p>This subject is delivered over six weeks in a blended format, so you will have a combination of self-study time via the modules here on Canvas and online webinars and on-campus sessions at the UTS city campus.</p>
<p>In this subject, we study the principles and methods of experimental research. You will learn the theory and good practices to design experiments in the field and test hypotheses. We will review confounds that can appear in an experimental study and how to ensure that an experimental project delivers the right insights. We will also examine the generalisability of experiments and how we should review the existing experimental literature.</p>
<p>A useful resource to go into more depth is the book by <span>Glennerster and Takavarasha (2013) </span><em><a class="inline_disabled" href="http://runningres.com/" target="_blank">Running Randomized Evaluations. A practical guide</a>.&nbsp;</em>You can download chapters online from the UTS library.</p>
<p>The unit is organised into three main modules and they aim to answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Module 1 - Experimental foundations </strong>What is a trial? Why do we run experiments? What are the different types of experiments?</li>
<li><strong>Module 2 - Before the trial.</strong> How might you get buy-in for your trial? How do you define and diagnose a behavioural problem? How do you design or select an intervention?</li>
<li><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Module 3 - Running a trial. </strong><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">What are the steps in a trial? How do we design our data collection and analysis plans? How do we choose an intervention? What are the threats to the integrity of the trial?</span></li>
<li><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Module 4 - Statistical power and analysis. </strong><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">How do we develop and test hypotheses? What is the power of a trial?</span></li>
<li><strong>Module 5 - Interpreting the literature.</strong> How should I interpret the experimental literature? Do experiments generalise?</li>
</ul>
<h2>Live sessions</h2>
<p><span>Live online sessions are held each teaching week on Zoom. Access the Zoom sessions through the </span><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://canvas.uts.edu.au/calendar" target="_blank">Canvas calendar</a><span>, or by clicking Zoom in the left-hand subject menu. Recordings of these sessions will be available after the session via the Zoom link in the subject menu.</span></p>

</ul>
<h2>Seminars</h2>
<p><span>There will be one in-person intensive seminar. If you are unable to attend, you can also join via Zoom.</span></p>
<h2>Assessment</h2>
<p>To complete this subject, you're expected to complete two assessments. The assessments are signposted with two different icons. The first, an open-book multiple choice quiz on course content in Modules 1 and 2, will comprise 35% of your final grade. The second assessment will comprise the remaining 65%. Your final mark will be calculated based on your performance on both assessments.</p>
<p>Click on the Assignment tab in the left-hand column to learn more about your assessments. There, you will see the assignments when they are published. Enter the individual assignments to read all the necessary information you will need to complete them.</p>
