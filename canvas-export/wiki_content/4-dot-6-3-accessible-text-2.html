<li><strong>New program design -</strong> A problem has been identified, and a new solution is required. This might provide an opportunity to contribute to the program design and then test.</li>
<li><strong>New programs </strong>- When a program is new, and its effects are unknown, a randomised evaluation is the best way to estimate its impact.</li>
<li><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">New service - </strong>When an existing program offers a new service, rollout of the new service can be randomised.</li>
<li><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">New people - </strong>Programs often expand by adding new people. When there are not enough resources for everyone, randomising may be the fairest way to decide who will be served first. For example, Oregon had limited funding to extend Medicaid (health insurance for low-income people) to more people. They held a lottery to decide who would be offered the service.</li>
<li><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">New locations - </strong>Programs often expand to new locations. People in the new location may be added progressively through randomisation.</li>
<li><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Oversubscription - </strong>When demand outstrips supply, random assignment may be the fairest way to choose participants. The government in Colombia uses a lottery to decide who receives secondary school tuition vouchers. The US government uses a lottery to decide who receives vouchers for housing in more affluent neighbourhoods.</li>
<li><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Undersubscription - </strong>When the take-up of a program is low, we can increase demand by encouraging a random group. For example, a large American university encourages some employees to attend an information session on their retirement savings program.</li>
<li><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Rotation - </strong>If people take turns accessing the program, the order in which program resources rotate can be decided randomly, with the group on rotation serving as the treatment group. If we do this, we need to consider effects lingering after the program has rotated to another group.</li>
<li><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Admission cutoffs - </strong>Some programs have admission cutoffs. Those just below the cutoff could be randomly admitted. For example. if a bank approves loans to applicants with a credit score above 60, a random selection of applicants with scores between 55 and 59 could be approved. Those with scores in that range but not approved would form the control group.</li>
<li><strong style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Admission in phases - </strong>If resources are going to grow, people may be admitted to the program as resources become available.</li>
