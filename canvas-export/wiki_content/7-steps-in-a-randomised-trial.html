<p>You have designed a behavioural intervention. Here are the steps to test it in a randomised trial:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Define the outcome measure</strong><br>What outcomes will be used to measure impact?</li>
<li><strong>Random assignment</strong> <br>You need to allocate participants into a treatment and a control group.</li>
<li><strong>Data collection plan</strong> <br>Collecting data is complex and you need a detailed plan on how this will take place.</li>
<li><strong>Pilot</strong> <br>Although not essential, it is good practice to pilot your intervention and survey instrument before rolling them at scale.</li>
<li><strong>Trial Implementation</strong> <br>It can be useful to put in place a process evaluation to know whether the program is being implemented as planned and how well it is functioning.</li>
<li><strong>Data analysis</strong> <br>After you have implemented the intervention and completed your data collection, it is time to analyse the data to assess whether it achieved its core objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll discuss these steps in more detail over the following pages.</p>
