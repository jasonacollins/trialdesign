<p>Assessing operations on paper. For each step in the theory of change, an operations plan should articulate the tasks that must be performed to achieve it, by whom, and when. If there isn’t one already, we must write one so that we will know how the program is supposed to be carried out. For example, imagine that we are conducting an anti-malaria program that distributes mosquito nets at prenatal clinics. We have to buy the nets, recruit the clinics into the program, deliver and store the nets, inform the target population, give the nets to the targeted people only, and so on. Th e operations plan outlines all the program tasks, and an analysis of this plan may reveal potential problems.</p>
<p>Following paper trails. We can then examine paper records to see if the operations plan has been followed. We would want to trace the flow of money, determine the delivery dates of inputs, ensure that time targets were met, and, where possible, assess the rates of use of the new facility or program.</p>
<p>Assessing operations in the field. A paper review should ideally be accompanied by some on-the-ground checking. The records may say that the attendance rate at a new school is high, but a good process evaluation will check the records against reality. A small number of random visits will quickly tell us whether the paper records are accurate and, if not, how great the gap is between the records and reality. We should also interview beneficiaries to hear their side of the story. Are they using the new school? How do they find it?</p>
