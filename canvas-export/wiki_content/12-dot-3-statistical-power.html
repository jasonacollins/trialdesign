<p>The probability of a <strong>Type II error</strong> is <img class="equation_image" title="\beta" src="https://canvas.uts.edu.au/equation_images/%255Cbeta" alt="LaTeX: \beta" data-equation-content="\beta" loading="lazy">, the probability that you will not reject the null hypothesis when it is false.&nbsp;A related concept is <strong>power</strong>, which is the probability that you will <em>reject</em> the null hypothesis when it is false. Power is equal to 1 - <img class="equation_image" title="\beta" src="https://canvas.uts.edu.au/equation_images/%255Cbeta" alt="LaTeX: \beta" data-equation-content="\beta" loading="lazy">.</p>
<p>Questions related to the Type II error rate for a trial are typically framed in terms of power. How can I design my trial so that it has enough power to reject the null hypothesis in circumstances where it is not true? Alternatively, how can I increase the probability that my trial will achieve statistical significance when the null hypothesis is not true?</p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 18pt;">Calculating power</span></h2>
<p>Statistical power can be calculated with the following variables:</p>

</li>
</ul>
<div id="tab-1" style="font-size: 1rem; border: solid 1px #C7CDD1; border-width: 0px 1px 1px 1px;">
<p>The stricter the significance level that you use in your experiment, the lower the power of the experiment. There is a trade-off between Type I and Type II errors. As you decrease the probability of false positives by using a stricter significance level, you also decrease the probability of true positives. You should not relax the significance level to achieve power, but should be aware of the consequences of making it more strict.</p>
<p>It may seem counterintuitive that moving from a 5 percent to a 10 percent cutoff level for significance increases power, so let us use an <br>analogy provided by <span>Glennerster and Takavarasha (2011)</span>.</p>
<blockquote style="background: #f9f9f9; margin: 25px 0px; padding: 15px 25px 15px 25px; border-left: 6px solid #c266ff;">
<p>Imagine that we are the jury in a murder trial and we have to decide whether Xi is guilty or not guilty of poisoning Yi based on evidence presented in court. The prosecution submits 20 pieces of evidence.</p>
<p>Because not one of us on the jury was present when the poisoning took place, there is always a chance that we could reach the <br>wrong verdict, either saying that Xi is not guilty when he really did poison Yi or saying that he is guilty when he really is innocent. Recognizing this, we decide to set a standard for how stringent we should be. We say that we will convict Xi only when the probability that we could be wrong is 5 percent or less; if it’s any higher we will say that he is not guilty. That is, each of us will vote to convict only if we find at least 19 of the 20 pieces of evidence put forward convincing and at most 1 of them unconvincing. If 2 are unconvincing, we vote not guilty. At the 10 percent level, we will need at least 18 convincing pieces of evidence and allow for two unconvincing pieces. We will vote not guilty if 3 are unconvincing.</p>
<p>Power is the probability that we will find Xi guilty when he really did commit the murder. We are more likely to find him guilty the more pieces of unconvincing evidence we choose to ignore. At the 5 per cent level, we will find him guilty even if one piece of evidence is unconvincing, but at the 10 percent level we will do so if 2 pieces are, at the 30 percent level if 6 pieces are, and so on.</p>
<p>The less stringent we are, the more likely we are to convict Xi when he is guilty but also when he is not guilty.</p>

<p>What is the magnitude of the effect of your intervention? The larger the effect size, the more power the experiment has to detect an effect and generate a statistically significant outcome.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as you have not yet run the experiment, you do not know what the effect size is. If there are other studies with which parallels can be drawn, you can make an educated guess as to its likely size. You might generate your estimate through a literature review, pilot studies or other related experiments.</p>
<p>Estimates of the effect size should be conservative. The experimental literature is full of over-exaggerated effect sizes. An overestimate of the effect size will overestimate the power of the experiment.</p>
<p>You also need to understand the variability of the effect size (such as its standard deviation in the population of interest) to calculate power. A highly-variable effect will have a higher standard error in its measurement, so more probability of getting an extreme result that generates an error.</p>
<p>As a result, when an effect size estimate is made, it is typically made as a standardised effect size. This is the magnitude of the effect divided by the standard deviation. How many standard deviations is the effect?</p>
<p>You don't have the ability to increase the effect size. However, variation in the effect size is affected by things such as measurement error. More precise measurement can increase power.</p>

<p>Power is a function of the sample size of the experiment. It is the factor over which you have the most control.</p>
<p>Increasing the sample size reduces the standard error of your estimated effect size. This means that, if the alternative hypothesis is true, you will have a greater probability of detecting an effect of any given size. This can be seen in the following diagram: a larger sample size results in lower standard error, which is reflected in a narrower probability distribution for your estimate.</p>
<p>Click on the arrows to increase or decrease the sample size.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond increasing power, larger samples have other benefits such as reducing the extent to which we overestimate the effect size. We will discuss this more in coming material.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Power is calculated by asking, given the critical value implied by the chosen significance level, what effect size is required such that 1- <img class="equation_image" title="\beta" src="https://canvas.uts.edu.au/equation_images/%255Cbeta" alt="LaTeX: \beta" data-equation-content="\beta" loading="lazy"> of the probability distribution for the estimated effect size will be above the critical value.</p>
