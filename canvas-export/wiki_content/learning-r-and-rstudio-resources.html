<p>If you have never used R or RStudio before, below I briefly demonstrate the R and RStudio interface and link some introductory resources.</p>
</div>
<h2>R</h2>
<p>If you open R by itself, you are presented with a bare-bones workspace. You can type commands and receive the result.</p>

<p>You can open an editor to work on your code, which provides basic functionality.</p>

<p>However, people typically work within an IDE that makes using R easier. RStudio is one of the most popular for R.</p>
<h2>RStudio</h2>
<p>The RStudio interface on opening looks as follows. The panel on the left is the R workspace. The panel on the top right shows what objects are stored in memory (the environment). Other tabs in that panel allow you to see your command history, any open connections and a link to a tutorial. The bottom right panel has many purposes: it allows you to find and load files by clicking (rather than the workspace command line), view and load packages, seek help and view visual outputs.</p>

<p>You can also open a new file (typically an R script, R Markdown file or quarto file) where you can develop your code. After selecting File on the top menu, New. File and then R Script, I have the following. I can develop code in the top left panel, and then send it to the bottom left for execution.</p>

<h2>Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://rladiessydney.org/courses/ryouwithme/" target="_blank">RYouWithMe</a>: A gentle, intuitive introduction to using R. Probably the best resource if you are starting from absolute zero. Work through the BasicBasics modules to get a feel of the basic functionality.</li>
<li><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://moderndive.netlify.app/1-getting-started.html" target="_blank">Getting started with Data in R</a>: A more wordy, slightly less friendly introduction, but a good resource on the basics. Working through Chapter 1 will give you a good grounding in R and RStudio basics.</li>
<li><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/" target="_blank">A selection of resources</a> developed in the learnr package.</li>
<li><a class="inline_disabled" href="https://education.rstudio.com/learn/beginner/" target="_blank">A catalogue of resources</a> provided by RStudio Education gives you a range of suggestions if you want to take this further.</li>
</ul>
