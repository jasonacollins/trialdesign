On each ball is written a number. If you knew how many balls there were and the value written on every ball, you could write a mathematical function giving the probability that you would pull out any particular value. That mathematical function is the probability distribution.</p>

The probability distribution is a 1 in 6 chance of rolling a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.</p>

<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;">The normal distribution</span></h2>
<p>The most well known probability distribution is the "normal distribution".</p>
<p>The normal distribution is a probability distribution for a continuous variable. It is described by just two parameters: the mean and standard deviation. As you can see from the shape of the distribution, the normal distribution is sometimes called the bell curve.</p>
<p>The way to look at this distribution is that the area under the curve between any two points on the x-axis represents the probability of a draw of a variable from a population falling in that area. This particular curve has a mean of zero and standard deviation of 1. The standard deviations are marked along the bottom.</p>

<p>Approximately 50% of the mass of a normal distribution falls within 0.67 standard deviations of the mean. 68% is within one standard deviation and 95% within two standard deviations. This means that if I drew random numbers from this normal distribution, 68% would be between -1 and 1, and 95% would be between -2 and 2.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Many natural phenomena approximate normal distributions. For example, human height is roughly normally distributed. Males are on average 5'10" with a standard deviation of 4 inches, and women 5'5" with a standard deviation of 3.5 inches. (This obviously varies across countries etc.) As a result, we can say that 95% of men are between 5'2" and 6'6", and 95% of women are between 4'10" and 6'0".</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Normal distributions are valuable to us in this course as the properties of many of the variables conform to a normal distribution. For example, suppose we conduct an experiment many times, each time getting a mean of the observed values. Each time that mean will vary slightly by chance. The distribution of that mean will approximate a normal distribution.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-size: 24pt;">Student's t-distribution</span></h2>
<p>An almost equally famous distribution, at least in statistical circles, is Student's t-distribution. It is used in statistical tests instead of the normal distribution when the population standard deviation is unknown and the sample size is small.</p>
<p>The student's distribution resembles a normal distribution, but has heavier tails, which means that more extreme results are more probable. As the sample size increases, the t-distribution approaches the normal distribution. For large sample sizes, they are practically equivalent.</p>
