Different Possible Causal Mechanisms (An Apple A Day)

Four linear flowchart diagrams of different mechanisms, each formed from four components and three connections.

Mechanism 1:
Inputs (apples, people in poor health) → Intermediate Result (apples eaten) → Intermediate Result (improved nutritional status) → Final Result (improved health)

Mechanism 2:
Inputs (apples (could use oranges), people with vitamin C deficiencies) → Intermediate Result (apples eaten) → Intermediate Result (adequate levels of vitamin C) → Final Result (reduced incidence of scurvy)

Mechanism 3:
Inputs (apples (could use red onions), people at risk of cancer and/or heart disease) → Intermediate Result (apples eaten) → Intermediate Result (increased levels of quercetin) → Final Result (reduced incidence of heart disease and/or prostate inflammation)

Mechanism 4:
Inputs (apples (could use carrot sticks), obese and overweight people) → Intermediate Result (apples eaten) → Intermediate Result (decreased consumption of junk food) → Final Result (reduced incidence of obesity and associated conditions)
