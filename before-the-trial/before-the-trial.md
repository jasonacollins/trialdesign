# Before the trial

In this part, I cover some steps you will take before trial design.

-   What is the problem you are trying to solve?
-   What behaviour is leading to the outcome?
-   What is our theory of the current behaviour?
-   What interventions might influence the behaviour?

By the end of this module, you will be able to answer the following questions:

- How might you get buy-in for your trial?
- How do you define and diagnose a behavioural problem?
- How do you design or select an intervention?
