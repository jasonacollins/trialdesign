# Partial compliance

Partial compliance occurs when some people in the treatment group do not take up a program or others in the comparison group do.

**Partial compliance can occur when:**

- People in the treatment group are not treated. For example, some clients assigned to a mailing information intervention may never open the letter.
- People in the treatment group do not complete the treatment course. For example, some firms in a fertiliser program may save fertiliser for the next planting season or sell it instead of using it for the current season.
- People in the comparison group receive the treatment. For example, control group members may move to a treatment group location.
- Implementation staff depart from the allocation or treatment procedures. For example, program managers could deviate from the randomised allocation and extend services based on their judgment of need or personal relationships.
- People exhibit the opposite of compliance. In some unusual cases, providing access to a program or encouraging take-up of the program may have a perverse effect and reduce takeup. Similarly, excluding people from a program may make them think they are missing out on something great and generate greater take-up. People who behave in this counterintuitive way are called defiers (reacting in exactly the opposite way to what we predicted in the protocol).

**Non-compliance can undermine the trial in the following ways:**

- Noncompliance can reduce comparability between the treatment and comparison groups. The program we want to evaluate should be the only systematic difference between the treatment and comparison groups. Partial compliance by implementation staff can reduce comparability between the two groups.
- Noncompliance can reduce the difference between the treatment and comparison groups in exposure to the program. To detect a program's impact, our treatment group must be significantly more likely to receive the program than those in the comparison group. Partial compliance narrows the gap in actual treatment rates between the groups.
- Defiers can make it impossible to estimate the true impact of a program.

**To limit partial compliance, we can:**

- Make take-up of the program easy. Complicated application procedures can sharply reduce take-up, as can inconvenient locations.
- Incentivise take-up of the program. We may want to encourage take-up by providing a small incentive. We do not want the incentive to be so large that it will change outcomes.
- Include a basic program that everyone receives, including the comparison group

To account for partial compliance in the analysis, we have to document compliance in the treatment and comparison groups in the same way.
