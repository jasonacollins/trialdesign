# Random sample versus random assignment

In both **random assignment** and **random sampling,** we use a **random process** to select units (individuals, households, schools, etc.). But there is a crucial difference.

In random sampling, we take a population and use a random process to select units and create a group that is representative of the entire population. We can then measure the characteristics of this group and infer from them the characteristics of the entire population. (Most surveys use this approach.)

In random assignment, we take a study population—a pool of eligible units—and use a random process to assign units to different groups, such as treatment and comparison groups (i.e., we use it to determine access to a program).

**Random assignment:**

- Units (people, schools, etc.) are randomly assigned to different groups (e.g. treatment and comparison).
- Creates two or more comparable groups.
- Basis of randomised evaluation.

**Random sampling:**

- Want to measure the characteristics of a group (e.g. average height).
- Measure a random sample of the group.
- Often used during randomised evaluations, especially group level randomisation.
