# Three research designs

We have discussed three aspects of the intervention that we can randomise: access, timing and encouragement.

Another dimension to consider is how we can create variation in exposure to the program. Here I discuss three: the basic lottery, a lottery around the cutoff and the phase-in design.

## The basic lottery

The basic lottery randomises access to the intervention and leaves the treatment status unchanged throughout. We compare those with and without access to the intervention.

The basic lottery is most workable when a program is oversubscribed, resources are constant for the evaluation period, and it is acceptable that some receive no intervention.

Advantages are that it is familiar, understood, generally seems fair, easy to implement and allows for estimation of long-term impacts.

A disadvantage is differential attrition, as units in the control group may have little reason to cooperate with the survey.

## Lottery around the cutoff

A lottery around the cutoff randomises the intervention among those close to an eligibility cutoff. This strategy is workable when eligibility is determined by a scoring system, and there are many participants.

A disadvantage of this strategy is that it measures the impact of the intervention only on those close to the eligibility cutoff.

## Phase-in

The phase-in strategy randomises the timing of access and switches groups from control to treatment over time. It compares those with access to those who have not yet received access. This strategy is most workable when everyone must eventually receive the program and resources are growing over time.

An advantage of this approach is that phased roll-outs of interventions are common, and the control group may be more willing to cooperate in anticipation of future benefits.

A disadvantage is that the control group is of limited duration, meaning there is a limited time over which impact can be measured. Anticipation of the treatment may also affect the behaviour of the control group.
