# Reading research

As part of your review of the literature, it is important to be able to understand the research articles that describe the motivation and results of trials.

They will often be organised as follows:

- Introduction ​
- Theory (not always in empirical papers; this section may be hard to read and you are probably ok to skip if you understood the introduction)​
- Data (this will typically include a table of descriptive statistics, see video below on how to read such a table)​
- Intervention (sometimes, the paper will describe the intervention in details)​
- Results (this will typically include regression outputs, see video below on how to read such a table)​
- Conclusion

Let's work through a concrete example. Please download and start reading the following article:

> Carter, S. P., Greenberg, K., & Walker, M. S. (2017). [The impact of computer usage on academic performance: Evidence from a randomized trial at the United States Military Academy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775716303454). *Economics of Education Review*, *56*, 118–132.

## How to read the tables

The following video will help you understand how to read the tables in research papers.

## Activity

Using the comment box below, discuss whether, based on this study you think high schools in Australia should allow laptops in the classroom. Please explain your answer.

*Note: This was originally an interactive discussion in Canvas. Consider the following when forming your response:*

- What were the specific findings of the Carter et al. study?
- What was the context of the study (United States Military Academy)?
- How might this context differ from Australian high schools?
- What are the limitations of generalizing from this specific trial?
