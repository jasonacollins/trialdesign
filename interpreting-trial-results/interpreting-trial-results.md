# Interpreting trial results

In this part, I will examine the challenges of interpreting and scaling trial results. How do we read and interpret published trial results? Can we trust them? What happens when we scale our or other's interventions, move from lab to field, or change the context?

By the end of this part, you will be able to answer the following questions:

- What is the replication crisis and its causes?
- How generalisable are trials to new contexts?
