# Navigating the literature

It may be useful in your journey of running a trial to conduct a literature review of existing articles. Literature refers here to a collection of published materials on a particular area of research or topic, such as books and journal articles. A literature review seeks to summarize the information that existing studies have gathered on these issues. It will help you answer the following questions:

- What studies have already been done in this area?
- Are there gaps in the evidence?
- What are some of the general lessons that emerge from the many different studies?

Once you have selected the studies, it is important to be able to read or skim-read them in an educated way.

## Reading research

As part of your review of the literature, it is important to be able to understand the research articles that describe the motivation and results of trials.

They will often be organised as follows:

- Introduction ​
- Theory (not always in empirical papers; this section may be hard to read and you are probably ok to skip if you understood the introduction)​
- Data (this will typically include a table of descriptive statistics, see video below on how to read such a table)​
- Intervention (sometimes, the paper will describe the intervention in details)​
- Results (this will typically include regression outputs, see video below on how to read such a table)​
- Conclusion

The following video will help you understand how to read the tables.
